# Volume control with Arduino
The goal of the project is to be able to control the volumne of your pc using ultrasonic distance sensors and an Arduino controller. The only thing that we would have to do is just approach the hand over one of the sensors and the volume will increase/decrease.

## Requirements
1. Arduino UNO R3 (1)
2. Protoboard (1)
3. Wires (approximately 15)
4. HC-SR04 Ultra Sonic Sensors(2)

## Software requirements
1. Arduino 1.8.10 (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
